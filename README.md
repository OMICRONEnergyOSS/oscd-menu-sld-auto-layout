# oscd-menu-coord-tools

OpenSCD menu plugins for positioning, copying, and cleaning SLD coordinates.

The positioner is intended as a starting point for documents that already
contain primary plant data but do not yet contain SLD coordinates.

## Behavior

- Substations are laid out as vertical stacks of voltage levels.
- Each voltage level contains a single row of bays.
- Each bay uses three conceptual columns: one IED column and two conducting-equipment columns.
- IED scope allocation follows the old OpenSCD zeroline `attachedIeds` logic.
- Direct non-bay primary equipment under `VoltageLevel` or `Substation` is also placed in a second pass so transformer-heavy models still get a usable starting layout.
- IED names are placed underneath their symbols. Measured label footprints determine
  IED spacing, equipment column widths, row heights, and enclosing container sizes.

Stored layout data follows the
[OpenSCD SLD extension schema](https://github.com/openscd/oscd-extensions/blob/main/SSD/SLD/v0/ssd-sld-v0.xsd).
Placement and measurement use diagram/grid units, not browser pixels or the
editor's zoom setting. Labels are measured with native SVG text after the font
is available, with measurements cached for each name and font size during a run.
The current editor's default typography and label-coordinate rendering offsets
are isolated in `src/foundation/sld-editor-foundations.ts`; layout-specific
clearance, label placement, and conservative symbol envelopes live in
`src/foundation/layout-geometry.ts`. No hidden editor instance is used.

This remains a first-pass row/column layout, not a general collision solver.
It assumes the editor's default fonts and does not avoid existing wires,
free text, or other manually positioned obstacles. Custom font overrides or
unusual transformer decorations can require manual adjustment.

## Coordinate tools

Two additional, independent menu plugins are included. They do not automatically
synchronize competing coordinate systems or change auto-layout behavior.

| Plugin | Package export / browser bundle |
| --- | --- |
| SLD positioner | `oscd-menu-sld-positioner.js` |
| Copy SLDv1 to SLD Private | `oscd-menu-copy-sldv1-sldpriv.js` |
| SLD Coords cleaner | `oscd-menu-sld-coords-cleaner.js` |

The copier retains all Transpower SLDv1 source data, including legacy linked
IED placements and connectivity vertices. One unchecked checkbox controls
**all** conflicts: leave it unchecked to skip every existing destination layout
record, or check it to overwrite every matching record. Destination-only
attributes are retained; overwritten connectivity paths are replaced as a set.
The dialog reports the number of conflicting records, not individual attributes.
Ambiguous IED placements, duplicate destinations, and unsupported source data
block the operation with an explanation instead of guessing or partially copying.

The cleaner detects SLDv1, SLD Private, and IEC SXY data by namespace URI.
Detected systems are enabled but initially unchecked. Selecting every detected
system requires the additional acknowledgment:
“Are you sure? Removing all coordinates means nothing will appear on the SLD
Designer canvas”. Changing the selection resets that acknowledgment.
Selected layout attributes and Private sections are removed; vendor data and
unselected systems are retained. The cleaner closes after successful removal.
Mixed unrelated content inside a layout section
blocks removal rather than being discarded. Unused selected namespace
declarations are removed, but declarations referenced by QName metadata remain.

Each operation is one undoable EditV2 transaction. A changed document or
`docVersion` invalidates an open confirmation; close and reopen the plugin.
Reverse copying and SXY conversion are not implemented.

Register the additional plugins in the host's scoped registry just like
auto-layout, using their default class exports:

```js
import OscdMenuCopySldv1Sldpriv from
  '@omicronenergy/oscd-menu-coord-tools/oscd-menu-copy-sldv1-sldpriv.js';
import OscdMenuSldCoordsCleaner from
  '@omicronenergy/oscd-menu-coord-tools/oscd-menu-sld-coords-cleaner.js';

shell.registry.define('oscd-menu-copy-sldv1-sldpriv', OscdMenuCopySldv1Sldpriv);
shell.registry.define('oscd-menu-sld-coords-cleaner', OscdMenuSldCoordsCleaner);
```

Add corresponding menu entries with `requireDoc: true` and these `tagName`
values. Both are already registered in the demo.

## Install

```sh
npm install @omicronenergy/oscd-menu-coord-tools
```

## Register in oscd-shell

```js
import OscdMenuSldPositioner from '@omicronenergy/oscd-menu-coord-tools';

const shell = document.querySelector('oscd-shell');
shell.registry.define('oscd-menu-sld-positioner', OscdMenuSldPositioner);

export const plugins = {
  menu: [
    {
      name: 'Auto-position SLD elements',
      translations: { de: 'SLD automatisch layouten' },
      icon: 'account_tree',
      requireDoc: true,
      tagName: 'oscd-menu-sld-positioner',
    },
  ],
  editor: [],
  background: [],
};

shell.plugins = plugins;
```

The current shell uses a scoped registry. Register tagged plugins in
`shell.registry`, not the global `customElements` registry.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run start
```

Source lives in `src/`, with layout logic in `src/foundation/` and the menu
integration spec beside the entry point. Build, lint, test, and
development-server commands use `@omicronenergy/oscd-tooling`; browser tests
use Playwright. `npm run compile` remains an alias for `npm run build`.

`npm install` installs shared Git hooks through the `prepare` script and sets
this repository's `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks`.

`npm run build` compiles modules into `dist/`. `npm run bundle` creates the
browser-deployable plugin and bundled demo; `npm run start:bundle` serves that
bundled demo.

The demo starts without a document. Open a file using its File menu, or append
`?doc=sample.scd` to `/demo/` to load the included sample. It includes the
Source Editor and an SLD editor for graphical inspection.

The demo imports the npm SLD editor, pinned by the lockfile, which reads the
`OpenSCD-SLD-Layout` private elements generated by this plugin. The temporary
legacy deployment reads direct Transpower-namespaced attributes instead and
is not compatible with this output format.

## Packaging and deployment

The intended canonical repository is
[`OMICRONEnergyOSS/oscd-menu-coord-tools`](https://github.com/OMICRONEnergyOSS/oscd-menu-coord-tools).
The configured Pages endpoints, once deployed, are:

- Plugin: `https://omicronenergyoss.github.io/oscd-menu-coord-tools/oscd-menu-sld-positioner.js`
- Demo: `https://omicronenergyoss.github.io/oscd-menu-coord-tools/demo/?doc=sample.scd`

Use the plugin URL as a menu plugin's `src` in hosts supporting sourced
plugins. The standalone bundle contains its runtime imports; the bundled demo
also includes the compatible SLD editor.

`npm run build` produces the npm modules and declarations. The npm package
excludes demo output, tests, snapshots, and source maps. Build before manual
publication and inspect contents with `npm pack --dry-run`.

`npm run bundle` produces three independent, single-file plugin bundles and
the static demo under `dist`. The thin local Rollup config extends the shared
configuration only to add the two entry points.
`npm run deploy` bundles first, then publishes the output to the `deploy`
branch of the configured Git remote. This command writes to
the remote and should only be run intentionally against the canonical repo.

### Shared automation

The workflow callers use `OMICRONEnergyOSS/oscd-gh-workflows`:

- Unit tests run the build, lint, and Playwright tests on pushes and PRs.
- Continuous deployment bundles and pushes `dist` to `deploy` on `main`.
- Release Please maintains a release PR using conventional commits. Merging
  it creates a release, publishes the npm modules with provenance, and
  attaches zipped browser bundles.

### Owner setup before enabling releases

1. Make these files available in the canonical repository on `main`. This
   checkout may still point at a personal fork; package metadata does not
   change the Git remote.
2. Enable GitHub Actions and allow the shared workflows. Allow Actions to
   create and approve pull requests for Release Please. Workflow job
   permissions request the required repository writes and OIDC publishing.
3. Configure Pages to deploy from the `deploy` branch, root directory, after
   the first deployment creates that branch. If a workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   push does not trigger a Pages build, use an approved GitHub App/PAT secret
   for deployment or update the shared workflow to use Pages artifact
   deployment; do not embed credentials in the repo.
4. Ensure the npm scope/package is owned by the appropriate organization.
   For an unpublished package, an authorized maintainer may need to bootstrap
   the first publication before configuring its trusted publisher.
5. Configure npm's GitHub Actions trusted publisher for owner
   `OMICRONEnergyOSS`, repository `oscd-menu-coord-tools`, and workflow
   `release-please.yml` (the caller, not the reusable workflow's repository).
   Both caller and shared publishing job grant `id-token: write`, as required
   by npm's [trusted publishing documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/).
   No npm token is committed or configured by this project.
6. Review the first release PR's version before merging; the manifest starts
   at the current package version, `0.0.0`. PRs created with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   do not automatically trigger other workflows, so run checks manually on
   release PRs or use the organization's approved automation token.

### Known tooling limitation

Published `oscd-tooling` 0.0.6 passes literal quotes in its cleanup glob on
Linux, so a successful clean message can leave stale `dist` files. Until
the upstream fix is published, do not treat that message as proof of a clean
build; inspect/remove generated output before switching build modes. No
plugin-local tooling override is installed here.
